3. Evaluate the microeconomic and macroeconomic effects of tax cuts in the UK

Macro:

Demand increases: short term?

Increases disposable income -> rise in consumption -> outward shift of aggregate, this leads to a higher equillibrium level of real gdp, help close negative gap
Consumption is 60% of AD

however lower tax revenue, therefore when there is a recession this is likely to cause higher borrowing2
Eval:
Laffer curve
Inflatoion
