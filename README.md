6a) **Explain the market structure that best describes the market for UK online streaming services** (5)

Oligopolistic as there are a small number of dominant firms with substantial market share and customer base.
Interdependence of firms
High Barriers to entry, include brand loyalty or economies of scal e
Differentiated products
Market share in excess of 25%
Non-price competition
Interdependence

6b) **Do Netflix consumers behave rationally?** (10)

Economic rationality is when consumers aim to maximise utility/satisfaction.
Consumers do behave rationally as when prices increase, "200,000" subscribers are "forecasted to leave", this suggests that consumers are following the economic model of elasticity, as the magnitude of exiting consumers, suggest they are very price responsive/sensitive. This may also mean they have concluded that the utility gained from consuming Netflix, is outweighed by the price increase, hence they are "forecasted to leave".
Alternatively, not all consumers behave rationally, as outlined by the reference, "forgetful consumers" who do not "cancel free trials" follow the concept of inertia (tendency to not change),
  computational weakness, lack of information assymetric
  unused subscriptions do not maximise utility/satisfaction, assymetric information also displayed as they forget cancellation date, computation weakness do not understand price changes.

1c) Examine the likely numerical value of the XED between UK online streaming services

However, to evaluate in the long-run XED is more likely to be positive than in the short-run, as in the long-run enough time may have passed for new substitutes to enter the market, as opposed to in the short-run. Therefore, it can be stated that in the short-run XED is not strongly positve, compared to the long run. In addition, the strength of the substitutes can influence whether or not the XED value is positive, factors such as brand loyalty and platform-exclusive shows, such as the "mandalorian" on disney+ or stranger things on "netflix" may mean that rivals such as nowtv and netflix are weak substitues, as consumers will be less likely to switch to alternative platforms, due to their preferential attitude towards netflix and disney plus

Exchange Rates

1d) Private benefits are internal benefits of a transaction which are incurred by an individual consumer/producer and are taken into account by the price mechanism.
External benefits are benefits external to the transaction, spillover, positive third party effects ignored by the price mechanism.

1e) Discuss the likely impact of price discrimination on a firm's profit

Price discrimination involves charging a different price to different groups of people for the same good, based on their willingness to pay.

Price discrimination can achieve greater profits by targetting specific submarkets to generate more revenue and profit.


Forex markes are incredibly volatile, investors are constantly weighing up risks/benefits by assessing real-time geopolitcs, economic climate, causing prices to fluctuate

In 2015, when the pound appreciated, "Oxford Instruments" a firm which produces high techonology tools, reported a loss of all exports to Russia, as a result of the price change.

Currency appreciations trigger cheaper imports, multiple domestic firms report a loss in profits, as domestic consumers purchase cheaper imported goods.

At times, globalisation and FDI complement each other, the latter tends to come with its disadvantages. Take for instance the effect of "crowding out", FDI can crowd out domestic investment.
The British Government may have a preferential stance towards domestic investors, as profits are injected back into its own economy, thus the British circular flow of income and not leave as "leakages/withdrawls". FDI can also threaten economic welfare, as economic investors are less aware of consumer prerferences than domestic ones. Tesco malaysia.

Globalisation can indirectly give rise to "structural unemployment" in Western countries, as trade liberalisation encourages firms from the West to outsource their factories to the East, LIC's, attracting foreign firms as a way of reducing their own costs.

    - Distinction between automatic stabilisers and discretionary fiscal policy
        Automatic stabilisers are automatic fiscal changes as the economy moves through stages of the business cycle - e.g. a fall in tax revenues from the circular flow kj:
