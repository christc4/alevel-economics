## Past Paper Practice
### 2023 Paper 1

6a) **Explain the market structure that best describes the market for UK online streaming services** (5)

Oligopolistic as there are a small number of dominant firms with substantial market share and customer base.
Interdependence of firms
High Barriers to entry, include brand loyalty or economies of scal e
Differentiated products
Market share in excess of 25%
Non-price competition
Interdependence

6b) **Do Netflix consumers behave rationally?** (10)

Economic rationality is when consumers aim to maximise utility/satisfaction.
Consumers do behave rationally as when prices increase, "200,000" subscribers are "forecasted to leave", this suggests that consumers are following the economic model of elasticity, as the magnitude of exiting consumers, suggest they are very price responsive/sensitive. This may also mean they have concluded that the utility gained from consuming Netflix, is outweighed by the price increase, hence they are "forecasted to leave".
Alternatively, not all consumers behave rationally, as outlined by the reference, "forgetful consumers" who do not "cancel free trials" follow the concept of inertia (tendency to not change),
  computational weakness, lack of information assymetric
  unused subscriptions do not maximise utility/satisfaction, assymetric information also displayed as they forget cancellation date, computation weakness do not understand price changes.

1c) Examine the likely numerical value of the XED between UK online streaming services

However, to evaluate in the long-run XED is more likely to be positive than in the short-run, as in the long-run enough time may have passed for new substitutes to enter the market, as opposed to in the short-run. Therefore, it can be stated that in the short-run XED is not strongly positve, compared to the long run. In addition, the strength of the substitutes can influence whether or not the XED value is positive, factors such as brand loyalty and platform-exclusive shows, such as the "mandalorian" on disney+ or stranger things on "netflix" may mean that rivals such as nowtv and netflix are weak substitues, as consumers will be less likely to switch to alternative platforms, due to their preferential attitude towards netflix and disney plus

Exchange Rates

1d) Private benefits are internal benefits of a transaction which are incurred by an individual consumer/producer and are taken into account by the price mechanism.
External benefits are benefits external to the transaction, spillover, positive third party effects ignored by the price mechanism.

1e) Discuss the likely impact of price discrimination on a firm's profit

Price discrimination involves charging a different price to different groups of people for the same good, based on their willingness to pay.

Price discrimination can achieve greater profits by targetting specific submarkets to generate more revenue and profit.
Increasing prices for the inelastic submarket will cause a decrease in revenue

7) Evaluate possible methods of government intervention to control household energy bills in the UK

One possible method of government intervention is through subsidising energy providers.
This is because, in theory, subsidies reduce the marginal cost of supply as the extra funding given to energy providers should lead to an increase in output sold of good (e.g. charge per kWH of energy), leading to a lower price for consumers.

However, to counter-evaluate although this may reduce price per kWh of energy used, whether this "controls" household energy prices is debatable. For instance, subsidies may not be immune to supply-line disruptions i.e. "Russia-Ukraine war" or "international prices of fuel".


Is a subsidy part self-financing, will it create more tax revenue?
for example energy subsidy is good, but are government behavioural nudges needed to "control household energy pills", will subsidies achieve the desired stimulus to demand/consumption

Competitiveness is the ability to sell goods/services successfully at a profit in overseas markets.

### Paper 2 2023

5b) Explain the relationship between a fiscal deficit and the national debt

7) Evaluate macroeconomic policies

8) Evaluate macroeconomic policies apart from monetary policy the UK government could use to reduce inflation

Contractionary fiscal olicy involves increasing taxation and reducing government spending to decrease AD in the economy. Increased taxation, e.g. corporate tax, income tax, reduces revenue for firms and disposable income for consumers. Consumption and investment will decrease as smaller proportion of earnings...  negative multiplier effect, universal credit payments cut, reduce gov spending..


effectiveness depends on whether there are automatic stablisers in place which are counter cyclical to business cycle, such as job seekers allowance naturally occuring, more disposable income,however not always the cae, JSA more difficult to access, consumption may not increase.

the government can also pursue supply side policies, to reduce inflation by aiming to increase AS, by building new homes, productivity increases, lras shifts out, real output increases, but most significantly, price levels fall down from pl1 to pl2. However, building new homes can cause the positive wealth effect, ??


### Paper 3 2023

a) Explain one role of financial markets. (5)

One role is to facilitate loans, loans to individuals,

b) Why do retailers on high street remain small.

One reason is high barriers of entry, the nature of the "high street" especially in cities such as London, Oxford St, high rent.market may be very concentrated and require large economies of scale, high fixec costs,

they might also remain small to avoid diseconomies of scale, most specifically to avoid the principal agent problem, this is when business owners have less control over workers. this leads to increased average costs,

c) Discuss possible methods of price and non-price competition that firms could use to increase the value of sales on the high street.

Price discrimination. Nail salon can charge different consumers for same product, e.g. student discount to the elastic submarket of 16-18 year olds, they are highly elastic due to their lack of income, in comparison to the inelastic submarket who earn a substantial income and are inelastic to price as nail salons are a low % of income spent, due to the fact they have higher incomes.   π2 + π3 > π1. more profit is generated through price discrimination,

fact-check this,
price discrimination requires monopoloy power,

d) Evaluate the microeconomic and macroeconomic effects of falling house prices (25)

*check if its disinflation or deflation

A macro effect of falling house prices is demand-pull disinflation, as house prices fall in 2008 by 17.5%, homeowners experience the negative wealth effect. As the value of their assets decrease, homeowners in the UK feel less wealtheir, despite no change in come. fall in MPC, thus consumption falls, consumption is a component of AD, around 60, therefore ad will shift inwards, to strengthen this point 60% of the uk population are homeowners, this fall in ad will lead to demand-pull disinflation as price levels fall from pl1 to pl2

## Specification Points

### 5.1.1 Size & Types of Firms

Divorce of ownership from control;

As firms grow -> sell shares to finance expansion -> shareholders and managers have different vested interests -> divorce of ownership and control

May lead to p.a problem -> interests do not allign, shareholders are not able to very easily monitor the behaviour of managers and vice versa,
Managers may benefit more from revenue maximisation than profit maximisation, managers may not act in the shareholders best interest

Shareholders can regain control from mangers, done by holding them accountable for firms performance adding pressure for them to perform in the shareholders interest. managers could also have their pay linked to the share price over a number of years, essentially realligning the goals.

Why some firms grow/small

Access to capital,
they may not have many customers to spread their fixed costs over,
if company cannot issue equity or borrow from banks, then it has bad access to capital

### 5.1.2 Business Growth

Organic growth, slower route than external expansion (through acquiring other businesss), but is usually less risky.

- increae production capacity, invest in new capital and technology, for example if firms products consistently selling out, then production capacity is restricting their expansion.
-
Launching new products, sell to people who are already customers,

virgin records, launched virgin trains, virgin atlantic, virgin active,
can be risky due to large investment and assymetric information, business owner may not be as knowledgeable in other product markets.

Opening new stores

**External growth:**
### CURRENCY

Poland's currency is the Zloty,
25% exports go to Germany.
A competitive depreciation against foreign currencies.
Lower interest rates, or intervene directly to sell Zloty supply and buy Euros.
Weaker currency, makes Polish products relatively cheaper in foreign markets, as less foreign currency is now needed to buy the same amount of Polish goods.
Polish exports make greater profits, increae capital investment, increase productivity to maintain competitiveness in long-term.

Although, in theory depreciation of the Zloty may improve price competitiveness internationally for Polish goods - In practice, the benefits may be eroded by the drawbacks of having a weaker currency. For example, when the external value of a currency falls, then the domestic price of imported goods inevitably rises. This causes a deterioriation in the terms of trade, such that Poland has to export more to pay for a given volume of imports. Detrimentally, this can and does lead to higher cost-push inflation which reduces the real income of Polish consumers and reduces profits from Polish companies, reliant on foreign imports. Higher relative inflation can therefore make Poland less competitive inside the EU single market.

A second approach to improve competitiveness could involve introducing  supply-side economic reforms to the economy. Once a transition economy, Poland has now deployed a number of market-friendly policies, during their move away from socialism. These have included reductions in corporation tax and income tax - for example income tax rates in Poland are 18% and 32% contrasted with 20% and 40% in the UK. Lower tax rates have encouraged a rise in the number of business start-ups and inflows of FDI into the economy. THis investment has added to the country's capital stock and has increased labour productivity. This in turn, is a key factor to causing real per capita incomes to rise. Inward investment also creates extra productive capacity which increases Poland's export potential. Foreign-owned firms are said to account for over half of Poland’s exports and the revenue from profits made by transnational businesses manufacturing in Poland also generates extra tax revenues



Forex markes are incredibly volatile, investors are constantly weighing up risks/benefits by assessing real-time geopolitcs, economic climate, causing prices to fluctuate

In 2015, when the pound appreciated, "Oxford Instruments" a firm which produces high techonology tools, reported a loss of all exports to Russia, as a result of the price change.

Currency appreciations trigger cheaper imports, multiple domestic firms report a loss in profits, as domestic consumers purchase cheaper imported goods.

At times, globalisation and FDI complement each other, the latter tends to come with its disadvantages. Take for instance the effect of "crowding out", FDI can crowd out domestic investment.
The British Government may have a preferential stance towards domestic investors, as profits are injected back into its own economy, thus the British circular flow of income and not leave as "leakages/withdrawls". FDI can also threaten economic welfare, as economic investors are less aware of consumer prerferences than domestic ones. Tesco malaysia.

Globalisation can indirectly give rise to "structural unemployment" in Western countries, as trade liberalisation encourages firms from the West to outsource their factories to the East, LIC's, attracting foreign firms as a way of reducing their own costs.

### 4.5.3 Public sector finances

    - Distinction between automatic stabilisers and discretionary fiscal policy
        Automatic stabilisers are automatic fiscal changes as the economy moves through stages of the business cycle - e.g. a fall in tax revenues from the circular flow kj:
