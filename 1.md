International competitiveness is the ability to sell goods/services at a profit in overseas markets. International competitiveness can be increased through policies such as.

One policy that may increase international competitiveness is an expansionary monetary policy. When the Bank of England (BoE) lowers interest rates, the return on assets, such as bonds, is reduced. Consequently, investors may shift their capital to countries with higher interest rates, as they seek higher returns. This capital outflow from the UK results in decreased demand for Pounds, exerting downward pressure on the UK exchange rate.
This exchange rate depreciation can benefit UK export markets, such as the automobile industry. The depreciation of the Pound relative to foreign currencies means that it takes fewer units of foreign currency to purchase the same amount of British automobiles. As a result, the purchasing power parity of foreign currency holders increases. In turn, this makes British cars more internationally attractive, as they become relatively cheaper for foreign consumers. The lower exchange rate effectively makes British exports more competitive in global markets, potentially leading to an increase in demand for UK products, including automobiles, from international buyers

However, depreciation to the pound could have adverse effects, particularly for the UK's two major export markets, namely automobiles and gas turbines, as they heavily rely on overseas components for 70% of their manufacturing processes. The potential consequence could be cost-push inflation, caused by an increase in unit costs. To mitigate these higher costs, UK export markets may find it necessary to pass on these cost increases to the international market. This could work against the objective of improving international competitiveness because the price of UK exports would rise, potentially leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded by foreign buyers.
